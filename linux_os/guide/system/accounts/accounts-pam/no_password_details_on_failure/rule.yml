title: 'Password Failure Message'

description: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} natively does not disclose to the login screen the reasons
    for a login failure.  The failed login output says "Permission denied" only;
    no indication as to whether the username or password was wrong.

rationale: |-
    Disclosing that an account exists can be just as useful as an attack vector as
    determining if the password entered was correct.
