title: 'Password Display on Entry'

description: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} natively obscures the typing feedback of authentication
    information during password entry.  No feedback is given while passwords
    are being typed.

rationale: |-
    The feedback from information systems does not provide information that would
    allow unauthorized individuals to compromise authentication mechanisms. For some
    types of information systems or system components, for example, desktops/notebooks
    with relatively large monitors, the threat (often referred to as shoulder surfing)
    may be significant. For other types of systems or components, for example, mobile
    devices with 2-4 inch screens, this threat may be less significant, and may need
    to be balanced against the increased likelihood of typographic input errors due to
    the small keyboards. Therefore, the means for obscuring the authenticator feedback
    is selected accordingly. Obscuring the feedback of authentication information includes,
    for example, displaying asterisks when users type passwords into input devices, or
    displaying feedback for a very limited time before fully obscuring it.
