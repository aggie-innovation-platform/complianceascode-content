title: 'Install libpam-pwquality Package'

description: |-
    {{{ describe_package_install(package="libpam-pwquality") }}}

rationale: |-
    <tt>libpam-pwquality</tt> is a PAM module to check password strength.
    Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a
    password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.
    Various password attributes that help to determine strength and how long
    it takes to crack a password. Use of more complexity in a password helps
    to exponentially increase the time and/or resources required to
    compromise the password.
