title: 'Set Password Checks to Limit Use of GECOS Information'

description: |-
    The pam_pwquality module's <tt>gecoscheck</tt> parameter controls requirements for
    not including identifiable information about the account. When set to a positive
    number, it will reject passwords which contain more than 3 characters from the passwd(5)
    GECOS field of the user. Modify the <tt>gecoscheck</tt> setting in <tt>/etc/security/pwquality.conf</tt>
    to be non-zero to prevent a run of 3 or more characters from the GECOS entry. The
    default is 0, which means that this check is disabled.

rationale: |-
    Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password.
    Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at
    guessing and brute-force attacks.
    <br /><br />
    Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The more
    complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the
    password is compromised.
    <br /><br />
    Passwords with personally identifiable information in them may be more vulnerable to password-guessing attacks.

ocil_clause: 'gecoscheck is not found or not greater than or equal to the required value'

ocil: |-
    To check if the gecos check is enabled, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep gecoscheck /etc/security/pwquality.conf</pre>
    Look for the value of the <tt>gecoscheck</tt> parameter. If gecoscheck is greater
    than 0, it is enabled. Which could appear as <tt>gecoscheck=1</tt>.
