title: 'Set Password Maximum Consecutive Repeating Characters'

description: |-
    The pam_pwquality module's <tt>maxsequence</tt> parameter controls requirements for
    consecutive monotonic character sequences. When set to a positive number, it will reject
    passwords which contain more than that number of consecutive monotonic characters.
    Modify the <tt>maxsequence</tt> setting in <tt>/etc/security/pwquality.conf</tt> to equal
    {{{ xccdf_value("var_password_pam_maxsequence") }}} to prevent a run of
    ({{{ xccdf_value("var_password_pam_maxsequence") }}} + 1) or more monotonic characters.

    The default is 0 which means that this check is disabled.  Examples of such sequence are
    '12345' or 'fedcb'. Note that most such passwords will not pass the simplicity check
    unless the sequence is only a minor part of the password.

rationale: |-
    Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password.
    Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at
    guessing and brute-force attacks.
    <br /><br />
    Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The more
    complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the
    password is compromised.
    <br /><br />
    Passwords with excessive consequitive sequences of characters may be more vulnerable to password-guessing attacks.

ocil_clause: 'maxsequence is not found or not greater than or equal to the required value'

ocil: |-
    To check the maximum value for consecutive monotonic sequence of characters, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep maxsequence /etc/security/pwquality.conf</pre>
    Look for the value of the <tt>maxsequence</tt> parameter. The default is 0, which would appear as
    <tt>maxsequence=0</tt>.
