title: 'Process for least privilege'

description: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} requires elevation via <tt>sudo</tt> or <tt>su</tt> to grant
    elevated privileges.

rationale: |-
    From sudo's website {{{ weblink(link="https://www.sudo.ws/intro.html") }}}:
    Utilizing <tt>sudo</tt> to momentarily elevate an account's privileges allows
    a system administrator to give certain users (or groups of users) the ability
    to run some (or all) commands as root while logging all commands and arguments.
    Sudo operates on a per-command basis, it is not a replacement for the shell.
    Its features include:
    <br />
    <ul>
    <li>The ability to restrict what commands a user may run on a per-host basis.</li>
    <li>Sudo does copious logging of each command, providing a clear audit trail
         of who did what. When used in tandem with syslogd, the system log daemon,
         sudo can log all commands to a central host (as well as on the local host).
         All admins should use sudo in lieu of a root shell to take advantage of this
         logging.</li>
    <li>Sudo uses timestamp files to implement a ticketing system, of sorts. When a user
         invokes sudo and enters their password, they are granted a ticket for 5 minutes
         (this timeout is configurable at compile-time). Each subsequent sudo command updates
         the ticket for another 5 minutes. This avoids the problem of leaving a root shell
         where others can physically get to your keyboard. There is also an easy way for a
         user to remove their ticket file, useful for placing in a .logout file.</li>
    <li>Sudo's configuration file, the sudoers file, is setup in such a way that the same
         sudoers file may be used on many machines. This allows for central administration
         while keeping the flexibility to define a user's privileges on a per-host basis.
         Please see the samples sudoers file below for a real-world example</li>
    </ul>
